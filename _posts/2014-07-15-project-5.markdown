description: Drawing at Christmas, a whimsical multiplayer game developed using Firebase and Canvas. I completed the app during a 24 hour Hackathon in a group of 4. Players view a common picture and draw together on one paint canvas, being able to view what the other players are drawing in real time. We decided to use Christmas at the styling focal point as we completed the site toward the end of December 2015.
